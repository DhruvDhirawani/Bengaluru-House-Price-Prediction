# Bengaluru House Price Prediction
 Bengaluru House Price Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using a machine learning model. By analyzing and cleaning real estate data, the project implements a Linear Regression model to provide price estimates based on key features such as the total square footage, number of bathrooms, balconies, and bedrooms. The primary objective is to create a robust model that helps potential buyers and real estate agents make informed decisions.

Problem Statement
Accurately predicting house prices is a critical challenge in the real estate industry. Buyers and investors need reliable models to understand property values, while sellers benefit from appropriate pricing strategies. This project addresses the problem by building a predictive model using historical data on housing prices.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, "Bengaluru House Data," contains various features, including:

Location: The area where the property is located.
Size: Number of bedrooms and type (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).
Total_sqft: Total area of the property in square feet.
Bath: Number of bathrooms.
Balcony: Number of balconies.
Price: The price of the property (in lakhs).
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Handling Missing Values:

Filled missing values for the 'bath' and 'balcony' columns with their median values.
Dropped rows with missing 'size' or 'total_sqft' values, as these features are essential for prediction.
Feature Engineering:

Extracted the number of bedrooms (BHK) from the 'size' column.
Converted 'total_sqft' values to numeric, accounting for ranges and non-standard entries.
Data Cleaning:

Dropped rows where 'total_sqft' could not be converted to a valid number.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution Analysis: Visualized the distribution of house prices to understand the data spread.
Scatter Plot: Created scatter plots to observe the relationship between total square footage and price.
Correlation Analysis: Generated a heatmap to analyze the correlation between numeric features.
Model Building and Evaluation
Feature Selection:

Chose key features: total_sqft, bath, balcony, and bhk to predict the house price.
Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split to validate model performance.
Model Training:

Used Linear Regression as the predictive model.
Trained the model on the training data and made predictions on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Calculated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²) score to evaluate the model's accuracy.
The MAE provides insight into the average error in predictions, while the R² score indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Results
MAE: Represents the average difference between predicted and actual prices.
R² Score: Indicates the model's effectiveness in explaining the variability of house prices.
Key Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and performance evaluation.
Conclusion
The Linear Regression model provides a foundational approach for predicting house prices in Bengaluru. While the results are promising, further model improvements can be explored. Future work could involve experimenting with more complex algorithms, incorporating location-based features, or employing ensemble methods for better accuracy.

Future Enhancements
Feature Engineering: Include more detailed features, such as location data and amenities.
Algorithm Exploration: Experiment with advanced models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to improve performance.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
